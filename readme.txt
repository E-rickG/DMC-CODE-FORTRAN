Wellcome to Difusion Monte Carlo Method in Fortran.
In this aplication we simulate a few potentials of a simple quantum systens.

The original algorithm was developed in C by Ioan Kosztin, Byron Faber and Klaus Schulten.
This algorithn is an adaptation, and adds new features.

Follow this paths to compile the application:
In the folder directory, open the terminal and put

chmod +x compile.sh
./compile.sh

To make the executable, use the following command

make -f MakeFile

Run with

./montecarlo

Enjoy!
